# Abstract
Memory is a storage space that is essential for storing the repetitive data and the instructions to perform an operation. In modern processors speed has been increased
significantly but memory enhancements are mainly focusing on the ability to store more data in less space and to reduce the latency. CAM cells are preferred over SRAM cells as they are faster and gives the address of the matched data whereas SRAM uses address to access particular data. The circuit of Modified Pre-charge free CAM cell proposed in this paper is made up of basic 6T SRAM cell (2 cross-coupled inverters and 2 access transistors) and separate comparison circuit (1 PMOS and 1 NMOS transistor). The 8X8 memory array consists of memory cells, row and column decoders, encoder, pre-charge circuits, sense amplifiers and write driver circuits. The various parameters like delay, dynamic power and power delay product are measured and compared with other CAM cells. CADENCE Virtuoso Tool is used for designing the various circuits in 90 nm technology. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested CAM cell outperforms other cells, hence it is employed to create the array structure. The 8X8 CAM array based on MPF CAM cell has less power and less delay when compared with other array structures.
